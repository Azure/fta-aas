## GitHub Actions

| Name | Status | GH Action | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Build React App | [![Build React App](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/ci.yml) | [ci.yaml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) | Triggered when a new PR is created against the **main** branch. It builds the react app and runs the tests. |
| Deploy React App | [![Deploy React App](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/cd.yml) | [cd.yaml](./.github/workflows/cd.yml) | Triggered whenever a push is made in the **main** branch (i.e., PR is merged). It builds the react app and then it deploys it in a static website of a storage account inside the **staging** environment. After the deployment in the **staging** environment is complete and the changes have been successfully reviewed and validated, a manual approval will be needed for the same GH action to deploy the react app in the **production** environment. |
| Detect Infrastructure Drift | [![Detect Infrastructure Drift](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/detect-drift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/detect-drift.yml) | [detect-drift.yml](./.github/workflows/detect-drift.yml) | Triggered when a new PR is created against the **main**, only when it contains changes in any *.bicep file. It detects infrastructure drift in the target environments (**staging** and **production**), running a --what-if deployment. |
| Provision Infrastructure | [![Provision Infrastructure](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/iac.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Azure/fta-aas/actions/workflows/iac.yml) | [iac.yaml](./.github/workflows/iac.yml) | Triggered whenever a push is made in the **main** branch (i.e., PR is merged), only when it contains changes in any *.bicep file. Provisions the infrastructure (storage account, app insights resource and enabling the static website) in the **staging** environment. After the deployment in the **staging** environment is complete and the changes have been successfully reviewed and validated, a manual approval will be needed for the same GH action to provision the infrastructure needed for the react app in the **production** environment. |

# Getting Started with Create React App and Fluent UI

This is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) based repo that comes with Fluent UI pre-installed!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This is the first step you should execute to download all dependencies. Usually you only need to run this command once.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build --configuration production`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
